Predictive Maintenance Dataset
<br>
Welcome to the Predictive Maintenance Dataset repository! This repository contains a dataset specifically curated for training and evaluating machine learning models in predictive maintenance tasks. 
The primary goal of predictive maintenance is to forecast the remaining useful life (RUL) of equipment or detect potential failures before they occur, allowing for proactive maintenance and minimizing costly downtime.

Data Description
The dataset provided here is stored in CSV format and consists of 10,000 samples. Each sample comprises features that are essential for predicting equipment health or RUL.
These features include sensor readings such as air temperature,process temperature,tool wear,torque,rotational speed.
The target variables in the dataset are tool wear failure,machine failure,heat dissipation failure,overstrain failure,power failure or any random failure.

Potential Use Cases
This dataset is intended for various applications, including but not limited to:

Training and evaluating machine learning models for predictive maintenance tasks
Benchmarking different model architectures in the predictive maintenance domain
Contributing to research efforts in predictive maintenance algorithms
Data Exploration and Visualization
To facilitate exploration and visualization of the dataset, a Jupyter Notebook is provided within the repository. This notebook demonstrates basic data exploration and visualization techniques, including:
Box Plots showing distribution of data w.r.t target,
Histograms showing frequency distribution of data with target,
scatter plots comapring features based on one of the target variable,
Identifying potential correlations between features,
Exploring data quality issues such as missing values
